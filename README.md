# March-Madness-Study
This is a multi-year Independent study of which stats predict the best march madness brackets. 25 different brackets were created in 2024 and 2025 based on various statistics and methods. 14 of the brackets were produced merely by picking the team who had higher statitics in certain categopries*. The other 12 brackets were picked through various methods listed in full detail in the other document in this repository. Some of the methods such as conference prestige are more analytical, while others are for fun such as mascot picks.

###Overall Results
Only two methods have correctly chosen the correct champion so far, the Mealor Method, and my own personal guess. These are also the top two brackets point-wise across multiple years. There has been only one bracket based off a single statistic, that consistently has a total of above 2500 points. The top-25 Away-Neutral record bracket has chosen one of the last two champions correct, and 75% of the final four games the last two years. Five other brackets have predicted one of the last 2 champions: Total offensive efficiency,
points per play vs top 35 teams, Total Efficiency vs top 35 teams, Offensive efficiency vs top 35 teams, and SEC / conference prestige.


###2025 results
2025 was a year with few upsets, which is why the Mealor Method was the best bracket, scoring 1530 points. Only the Mealor Method and Conference Prestige predicted Florida as the champion. Top 25 away-nuetral record, points per play vs top 35 teams, total Efficiency vs top 35 teams, Bart's picks, offensive efficiency vs top 35 teams, conference prestige, and total overall efficiency all produced good brackets in the range of 1100-1300 points.


###2024 Results
Many statistical brackets performed well, as UConn was a clear leader in many statisticasl categories, and more so than most previous champions. The bracket from total offensive efficiency produced the best bracket in the last two years from one statistic with 1510 points. Top 25 away-nuetral record, total offensive efficiency, points per play vs top 35 teams, total efficiency vs top 35 teams, and offensive efficiency vs top 35 teams all predicted UConn as the correct champion. Top 25 away-nuetral record, points per play vs top 35 teams, total efficiency vs top 35 teams, and offensive efficiency vs top 35 teams all produced brackets scoring between 1050-1400 points.
