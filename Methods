Intro:
This study uses 24 different methods to create March Madness brackets on espn.com. There are 17 methods using statistics from barttorvik.com,
and the other 7 are picked by other methods. Many of the statistical methods use both offensive and defensive forms of a certain statistics, and for these, I created graphs with the 
offensive side on the x axis, and the defensive stats on the y axis. The offensive statistics were relied on more, due to the fact that the past research of this project has 
shown that teams with better offensive statistics do better. Therefore, when teams are in nearly identical spots on the graph, the team with better offensive statistics 
will be picked first. All 24 methods are listed, and explained below:


---------------------------------------------------------------------Serious Qualitative Methods---------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Mealor Method bracket:
- Developed by my high school calculus teacher, Mr. Mealor. 
- move all 1 and 2 seeds to the elite eight first, then choose the rest of the games as you wish
- method I use for any bracket pools I enter

2) My guess:
- my own personal guess from the statistics, and my own knowledge of the teams

3) Conference Prestige:
- For every game, pick the team from the conference with the most teams in the tournament
- if two teams are in the same conference, choose the one with the higher seed  
- if they have the same seed and conference, choose the team with the higher end-of-year ranking from Barttorvik.com

4) Upset:
- The lower seed has to win every first round game



---------------------------------------------------------------------Fun Qualitative Methods---------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Emotional picks:
- pick every game based on what you want to happen 
- i.e.(Auburn is always the champion, and their rivals all lose in the first round)


6) Coin Flip:
- flip a coin to decide every game

7)Mascot Picks:
- pick games based on which mascot I like the most

10) points per play vs top 25 teams
- use bartorvik's plotting program to make a graph with the x-axis being offensive points-per-play and the y axis being defensive points-per-play allowed both against top 25 teams
- pick each game by which team has the highest offensive - defensive ppg according to the graph

23) Free throw % vs top 25 AN
- pick the team with the highest free throw percentage in top 25 away or nuetral site games

24) Fouls per game vs top 25
